class Minimax():
    """
    Decision rule for minimizing the possible loss in a worst case
    scenario. It assumes that the first player is maximizing his chance
    of winning, and its opponent is trying to minimize that same chance
    (i.e. maximize its own chances).

        """
        Improvement over the naÃ¯ve minimax algorithm that seeks to decrease
        the number of nodes evaluated by the algorithm through pruning: if a
        subtree of the game graph is proven to be worse than some previously
        analysed node, then it needs not be analysed and as such, may be
        discarded. Hence, deeper searches may be performed.

        Args:
            board:  a GomokuBoard object.
            depth:  maximum depth before end of recursion; deeper searches
                    may perform better, although at a cost.
            alpha:  maximum score that the maximizing player is assured of.
            beta:   minimum score that the minimizing player is assured of.
            player: a integer representing the maximizing player.

        Returns:
            A tuple containing the score for a given board, and the best move
            evaluated by the algorithm.
