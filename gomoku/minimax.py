"""minimax.py

Decision rule for minimizing the possible loss in a worst case
scenario. It assumes that the first player is maximizing his chance
of winning, and its opponent is trying to minimize that same chance
(i.e. maximize its own chances).

    """
    Improvement over the naÃ¯ve minimax algorithm that seeks to decrease
    the number of nodes evaluated by the algorithm through pruning: if a
    subtree of the game graph is proven to be worse than some previously
    analysed node, then it needs not be analysed and as such, may be
    discarded. Hence, deeper searches may be performed.

    Args:
        board:  a GomokuBoard object.
        depth:  maximum depth before end of recursion; deeper searches
                may perform better, although at a cost.
        alpha:  maximum score that the maximizing player is assured of.
        beta:   minimum score that the minimizing player is assured of.
        player: a integer representing the maximizing player.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing the score for a given board, and the best move
        evaluated by the algorithm.
